- use this web for [educational purpose- BEM](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/bem_by_example)
- Just as a reminder some of the CSS classes are defined in app.js and index.js

- the shortcut way of using overlay (one div upon another) that we used in Intro.css
  - Both div should be under same parent div.
  - prent div should be positioned relative (position:relativ)
  - the div which will be overlay on another must be positioned:
    - position: absolute
    - inset: 0
- using [nth-child](https://www.techonthenet.com/css/selectors/nth_child.php) in css. we used one in the footer container.
